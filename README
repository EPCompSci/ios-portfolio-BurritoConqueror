My first app was the about me app where I learned how to make constraints. After that I worked on
a clicker game that I called burrito clicker, but ultimately i didn't like the way it turned out.
Next I tried to recreate the app better using sprite kit. While making it I learned how to make sprite
programaticaly, receiving variables between multiple screens and how to do animations. Next I began to 
work on a group project called dungeon game. I helped make art and getting physics bodies. Finally I 
spent the rest of my time making art workand designing the map for gravity guy.
