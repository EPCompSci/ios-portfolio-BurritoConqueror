2018-2019 Portfolio

Using this space as the home base for your portfolio, make a wiki or pages like this read me to highlight what you have learned / created over this semester of class. You should consider this as much for your grade as your resume. You've got incredible work to highlight and brag about - do that here. 

I'd like you to consider this assignment as a way to get a job / internship / independent contract with someone outside the school.

Create links to group projects (create a new repo for completed apps) you've been working on, making sure the read me's have details about what the apps do in the format the app store asks - look at a couple apps to see what I'm talking about. Don't forget about those first simple apps you created - they still matter!

About Me App
https://github.com/BurritoConqueror/-about-me-app
This is the first app that I made. While making this app I learned how to use constraints and making buttons. In this app there are varius buttons that switch the image in the middle. All the images are pictures related to me(my favorite is the 1# victory royale picture). Some challenges in making this app were that I was new to xcode and had to learn all the things I used in my app for the first time.





Burrito Clicker
https://github.com/BurritoConqueror/Burrito-Clicker
This is the next app I made. In this game you tap on the burrito you get money. With the money you buy upgrades to make your taps worth more money. While making this app I incorporated what I learned in java together with the things i learned while making the about me app. Some new things I learned were how to change screens through using segues. After that I needed to learn how to pass the variables between. I learned about the prepare for segue function and function I would send variablse between the swift files. However, one thing I didn't like was how it looked. It looked blocky and rushed together.



SpriteKit Burrito Clicker
https://github.com/BurritoConqueror/SpriteKit-Burrito-Clicker
I decided to try making Burrito Clicker on sprite kit. Sprite kit lets you do more things like animation and makes the graphics looks smoother. This was my first app using sprite kit. I made the buttons out of sprites and used the did tough begin function to turn the sprite into a button. After that I made the purchase buttons. Next I set my sights on animating the burrito whenever you touched it. I tried using the animation command, I finally got it to work, but I realized that it was just more efficient to change the picture whenever the burrito was touched.

Dungeon Game
https://github.com/BurritoConqueror/Dungeon-Game
After making burrito clicker on sprite kit I joined a group with my friends and we decided to try to make a game inpsired by the Legend of Zelda. I made the artwork for some of the of the enemies and tiles. I used the knowledge I learned from burrito clicker to help animate the tiles. I also helped with putting the physics bodies on the tiles and comming up with game mechanics.

Gravity Dude
https://github.com/NathanielLudwig/Gravity-Dude
After running into roadblocks with Dungeon Game we started brainstorming on ideas for a new game. We decided to make a game like Bennet Foddey's Getting Over It. In this game you control the limbs of either a banana or a burrito. Using these and the slow motion and reverse gravity button you have to push yourself through the course. I made the burrito and banana character on piskel. I also made art work for the buttons. After that I designed our first map and a second map we decided not to use.
